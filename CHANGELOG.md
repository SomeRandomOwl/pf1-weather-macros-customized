Added capability to use SimpleCalendar to track weather for each day by a note on that day.  If SimpleCalendar is installed you can find a button labeled "Roll PF1 Weather" which will bring up the Dialog box as normal. When run it adds notes labeled "Weather Report" on the current day and any subsequent days based on the rolls generated according to the rules for weather in PF1.
